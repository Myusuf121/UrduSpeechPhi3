# Unlocking Urdu Speech Sentiment with Fine-Tuned Phi3 Model**

Natural Language Processing (NLP) has come a long way in bridging the gap between human communication and machine understanding, but one area that still presents challenges is the analysis of emotions from spoken language — especially in underrepresented languages like Urdu. This notebook takes on the exciting task of fine-tuning the Phi3 model to classify sentiments from an Urdu speech emotions dataset, showcasing a compelling application of modern machine learning techniques.

## What’s Inside the Notebook?**
This notebook is more than just code — it’s a hands-on guide for anyone interested in NLP, sentiment analysis, or the burgeoning field of speech emotion recognition. Here’s what it covers in detail:

**1. Understanding the Dataset**
The notebook begins by diving into an Urdu speech emotions dataset, providing insights into the structure and unique challenges of working with non-textual, multilingual data. This step involves:

Preprocessing Audio Data: Preparing the speech samples for modeling, including tasks like feature extraction and ensuring compatibility with the Phi3 architecture.
Labeling Sentiments: Associating each audio sample with emotion labels like happiness, sadness, anger, and more, forming the basis for supervised learning.2. Fine-Tuning the Phi3 Model

**2. Fine-Tuning the Phi3 Model**

Phi3 is a versatile pre-trained model designed for NLP tasks. However, adapting it to Urdu speech analysis involves thoughtful customization:

Model Adaptation: Transforming the Phi3 model’s architecture to handle features derived from speech instead of text.
Fine-Tuning: Training the model on the Urdu dataset, tweaking hyperparameters, and optimizing performance for accurate sentiment detection.

**3. Evaluation and Insights**
The final stage of the project focuses on evaluating the fine-tuned model:

Performance Metrics: Using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to gauge how well the model identifies emotions in Urdu speech.
Error Analysis: Identifying misclassifications and discussing potential causes, such as overlapping emotional tones or limitations in the dataset.
Why This Matters
Urdu, spoken by millions worldwide, is underrepresented in the world of AI and NLP. By fine-tuning a cutting-edge model like Phi3 for Urdu speech, this project not only pushes the boundaries of sentiment analysis but also contributes to creating more inclusive technologies that understand diverse languages and cultures.

**Who Is This For?**
Researchers: Explore a practical example of speech emotion recognition using state-of-the-art NLP tools.
Engineers: Learn how to adapt pre-trained models like Phi3 for unique datasets and tasks.
NLP Enthusiasts: Dive into the intersection of speech processing and emotion detection in a multilingual context.

Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced practitioner, this notebook offers valuable insights and inspiration for working with low-resource languages and advancing sentiment analysis.
